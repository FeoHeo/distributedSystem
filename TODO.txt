Content Server is basically a database server that will take a JSON file and upload that to the Aggregation server. Aggre server will serve as both aggregation point for data and a mini-database
that serves data to Client. There might be multiple content servers

[1: Java Messaging]
Implement a simple Java RMI to handle simple message input as string (Aggregation - Content - Client)
	-> RMI handle REST request (Aggregation)
	-> RMI handle JSON (Aggregation - Content)

[2: Lamport clock]
Make a simple Lamport clock (do this on a smaller test server first)
	-> Implement in servers (Aggregation - Content - Client)
